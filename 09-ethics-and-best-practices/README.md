## 🎯 Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Fairness & Non-Discrimination
**Principle**: AI systems should treat all individuals and groups equitably

**Implementation**:
- Diverse training data representation
- Regular bias testing across demographics
- Fairness metrics in model evaluation
- Inclusive design processes

**Example**: Ensuring hiring algorithms don't discriminate based on gender, race, or age

### 2. Transparency & Explainability
**Principle**: AI decisions should be understandable and auditable

**Implementation**:
- Use interpretable models when possible
- Provide explanations for AI decisions
- Document model development processes
- Clear communication about AI capabilities and limitations

**Example**: Medical diagnosis AI that explains its reasoning to doctors

### 3. Privacy & Data Protection
**Principle**: Respect user privacy and protect personal information

**Implementation**:
- Data minimization (collect only what's needed)
- Anonymization and pseudonymization techniques
- Secure data storage and transmission
- User consent and control over data

**Example**: Federated learning for mobile keyboards without sending personal messages

### 4. Accountability & Responsibility
**Principle**: Clear ownership and responsibility for AI system outcomes

**Implementation**:
- Clear governance structures
- Audit trails for AI decisions
- Human oversight and intervention capabilities
- Regular impact assessments

**Example**: Financial institutions taking responsibility for AI-driven loan decisions

### 5. Human Agency & Oversight
**Principle**: Humans should maintain meaningful control over AI systems

**Implementation**:
- Human-in-the-loop design
- Override capabilities for AI decisions
- User education about AI limitations
- Meaningful human review processes

**Example**: Autonomous vehicles with human override capabilities

## 🔍 Understanding Bias in AI

### Types of Bias

#### 1. Historical Bias
**What it is**: Past discrimination reflected in training data
**Example**: Historical hiring data showing preference for male candidates
**Mitigation**: Reweight training data, use synthetic data, focus on relevant skills

#### 2. Representation Bias
**What it is**: Some groups underrepresented in training data
**Example**: Face recognition trained mostly on light-skinned faces
**Mitigation**: Diverse data collection, stratified sampling, data augmentation

#### 3. Measurement Bias
**What it is**: Systematic differences in how data is collected across groups
**Example**: Credit scores measured differently across communities
**Mitigation**: Standardize measurement processes, account for systematic differences

#### 4. Evaluation Bias
**What it is**: Inappropriate benchmarks or evaluation metrics
**Example**: Using accuracy on unbalanced datasets
**Mitigation**: Use appropriate metrics (F1, AUC), test across subgroups

#### 5. Deployment Bias
**What it is**: System used inappropriately or in different context than training
**Example**: Medical AI trained on one population used globally
**Mitigation**: Context-aware deployment, local validation, continuous monitoring

### Fairness Metrics

#### Individual Fairness
Similar individuals should receive similar outcomes
```python
# Example: Similar loan applicants should get similar decisions
def individual_fairness(model, person1, person2, similarity_threshold):
    if similarity(person1, person2) > similarity_threshold:
        assert abs(model.predict(person1) - model.predict(person2)) < epsilon
```

#### Group Fairness
Different demographic groups should be treated equally
```python
# Example: Equal acceptance rates across groups
def demographic_parity(predictions, protected_attribute):
    group_rates = predictions.groupby(protected_attribute).mean()
    return group_rates.max() - group_rates.min() < tolerance
```

#### Equalized Opportunity
Equal true positive rates across groups
```python
# Example: Medical diagnosis should catch diseases equally across groups
def equalized_opportunity(y_true, y_pred, protected_attribute):
    tpr_by_group = []
    for group in protected_attribute.unique():
        mask = protected_attribute == group
        tpr = true_positive_rate(y_true[mask], y_pred[mask])
        tpr_by_group.append(tpr)
    return max(tpr_by_group) - min(tpr_by_group) < tolerance
```

## 🔒 Privacy-Preserving ML

### Techniques for Privacy Protection

#### 1. Differential Privacy
Add controlled noise to protect individual privacy
```python
import numpy as np

def add_laplace_noise(data, epsilon):
    """Add Laplace noise for differential privacy"""
    sensitivity = 1  # Adjust based on your data
    scale = sensitivity / epsilon
    noise = np.random.laplace(0, scale, data.shape)
    return data + noise
```

#### 2. Federated Learning
Train models without centralizing data
```python
# Conceptual federated learning process
def federated_learning(client_models, global_model):
    # Clients train on local data
    for client in client_models:
        client.train_on_local_data()
    
    # Aggregate model updates (not data)
    global_model.aggregate_updates(client_models)
    
    # Send updated model back to clients
    for client in client_models:
        client.update_from_global(global_model)
```

#### 3. Homomorphic Encryption
Compute on encrypted data
```python
# Example using tenseal library (simplified)
import tenseal as ts

def encrypted_inference(encrypted_data, model_weights):
    """Perform inference on encrypted data"""
    result = encrypted_data
    for layer_weights in model_weights:
        result = result.mm(layer_weights)  # Matrix multiplication
        result = result.square()  # Approximation of activation
    return result
```
