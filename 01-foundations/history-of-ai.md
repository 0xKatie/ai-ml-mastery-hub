# A Brief History: How We Got Here

Understanding AI's journey helps us appreciate where we are today and where we're heading tomorrow.

## The Dream Begins (1950s-1960s)
Picture this: It's 1950, and a brilliant mathematician named Alan Turing asks a simple question: "Can machines think?" This sparked a revolution. By 1956, at a summer conference at Dartmouth, the term "Artificial Intelligence" was born. The attendees were wildly optimistic – they thought human-level AI was maybe 20 years away. (Spoiler: they were a *bit* off!)

## The First AI Winter (1970s)
Reality hit hard. Turns out, making computers "think" was way harder than expected. Funding dried up, and AI became almost a dirty word in computer science. But a few dedicated researchers kept the flame alive.

## Expert Systems and Hope (1980s)
AI came roaring back with "expert systems" – programs that encoded human expertise into if-then rules. Companies invested millions. But these systems were brittle; they couldn't handle anything outside their rigid rules. Cue the second AI winter.

## The Statistical Revolution (1990s-2000s)
Here's where things get interesting! Researchers stopped trying to hand-code intelligence and started letting computers learn from data. This shift from "tell the computer exactly what to do" to "show the computer examples and let it figure it out" changed everything.

## The Deep Learning Explosion (2010s)
Remember when Facebook started magically tagging your friends in photos? That was deep learning in action. Three things came together:
1. **Big Data**: The internet gave us massive datasets
2. **GPU Power**: Graphics cards turned out to be perfect for AI
3. **Better Algorithms**: Researchers cracked the code on training deep networks

## The Transformer Era (2018-Present)
In 2017, Google researchers published "Attention Is All You Need" (best paper title ever?), introducing transformers. This architecture led to GPT, BERT, and eventually ChatGPT. Suddenly, AI could write, code, and converse almost like humans.

## Where We Are Now (2025)
We're living in an AI renaissance. Models can generate images from text, write code, diagnose diseases, and even do scientific research. It's both thrilling and a bit overwhelming – which is exactly why you're reading this!
