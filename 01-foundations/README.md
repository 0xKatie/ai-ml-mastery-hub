- **[Terminology Glossary](terminology-glossary.md)** - Your AI/ML dictionary

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this foundation section, you'll be able to:

✅ **Explain** what AI and ML are in simple terms  
✅ **Distinguish** between different types of machine learning  
✅ **Understand** the historical context and evolution of AI  
✅ **Use** proper AI/ML terminology confidently  
✅ **Identify** when AI/ML is appropriate for a problem  

## 🗺️ Recommended Learning Path

### For Complete Beginners
1. Start with [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) - build your mental model
2. Read [History of AI](history-of-ai.md) - understand the journey
3. Explore [Types of Learning](types-of-learning.md) - see the different approaches
4. Use [Terminology Glossary](terminology-glossary.md) as reference

### For Those with Some Background
1. Skim [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) for review
2. Focus on [Types of Learning](types-of-learning.md) for clarity
3. Reference [Terminology Glossary](terminology-glossary.md) as needed

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

After this section, you should understand:

**What AI/ML Really Is:**
- AI = Teaching computers to be smart
- ML = Learning from examples instead of explicit programming
- It's about pattern recognition, not magic

**The Three Main Types:**
- **Supervised**: Learning with a teacher (labeled examples)
- **Unsupervised**: Finding hidden patterns (no labels)
- **Reinforcement**: Learning through trial and error

**When to Use It:**
- Large amounts of data available
- Complex patterns humans struggle to code
- Tasks that benefit from automation
- Problems where "good enough" beats "perfect"

## ❓ Common Questions

**"Do I need a PhD in math?"**  
No! While math helps with advanced topics, you can build useful AI/ML applications with high school math and good intuition.

**"Is programming required?"**  
For building AI/ML systems, yes. But tools like AutoML are making it more accessible to non-programmers.

**"How long does it take to learn?"**  
- Basic understanding: 1-2 weeks
- Building simple projects: 1-2 months  
- Job-ready skills: 6-12 months
- Expert level: Years of practice

**"What if I get stuck?"**  
- Re-read the concepts with fresh eyes
- Try explaining it to someone else
- Check the [troubleshooting guide](../docs/troubleshooting.md)
- Ask questions in [Discussions](https://github.com/0xKatie/ai-ml-mastery-hub/discussions)
