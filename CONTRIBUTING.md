## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

```python
def calculate_accuracy(predictions, true_labels):
    """
    Calculate the accuracy of predictions.
    
    Args:
        predictions (list): Model predictions
        true_labels (list): Ground truth labels
        
    Returns:
        float: Accuracy score between 0 and 1
    """
    correct = sum(p == t for p, t in zip(predictions, true_labels))
    return correct / len(true_labels)
```

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, beginner-friendly language
- Include practical examples
- Add "Why this matters" explanations
- Use proper markdown formatting
