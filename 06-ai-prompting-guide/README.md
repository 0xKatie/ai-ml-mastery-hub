## üîë Key Principles

### The CLEAR Framework
- **C**ontext: Provide relevant background information
- **L**ength: Specify desired output length
- **E**xamples: Show what you want with samples
- **A**udience: Define who the output is for
- **R**ole: Ask the AI to adopt a specific perspective

### Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Vague requests get vague responses
2. **Provide Context**: Help the AI understand your situation
3. **Use Examples**: Show rather than just tell
4. **Iterate**: Refine based on initial results
5. **Experiment**: Try different approaches for the same task

## üß™ Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 2: Role-Playing
Ask an AI to help you prepare for a job interview by having it play the interviewer.

### Exercise 3: Chain-of-Thought
Get an AI to solve a complex problem by asking it to think step-by-step.

### Exercise 4: Template Creation
Create a reusable prompt template for a task you do regularly.
