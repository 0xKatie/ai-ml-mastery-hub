## 🔑 Key Takeaways

**Decision Framework:**
- AI/ML excels with large datasets and complex patterns
- Traditional programming is better for simple rules and 100% accuracy requirements
- Consider hybrid approaches for complex systems

**Getting Started:**
- Your current laptop is probably fine for learning
- Google Colab is free and perfect for beginners
- Invest in hardware only after you know your specific needs

**Best Practices:**
- Start simple and scale up
- Focus on problems you understand well
- Measure everything and iterate

## ❓ Common Questions

**"How do I know if my problem needs AI/ML?"**  
Use our decision framework in [When to Use AI/ML](when-to-use-ai-ml.md). Key indicators: lots of data, complex patterns, human experts struggle with consistency.

**"What hardware do I need to get started?"**  
Probably none! Check [Hardware Requirements](hardware-software-requirements.md) - Google Colab handles most learning projects for free.

**"I'm not a programmer - can I still learn AI/ML?"**  
Yes! Start with the concepts, then gradually build technical skills. Our guides assume minimal programming background.

**"How long before I can build something useful?"**  
With our guided approach: understanding concepts (1-2 weeks), first working project (1-2 months), job-ready skills (6-12 months).

🎯 **Pro Tip**: Don't try to learn everything at once! Master the decision framework first, then dive deep into areas that align with your goals and interests.
