# Getting Started with AI/ML Mastery Hub

Welcome to your AI/ML journey! This guide will help you take your first steps into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## 🎯 What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll:
- Understand what AI/ML is and why it's important
- Have a working development environment
- Run your first AI/ML program
- Know where to go next in your learning journey

## 🤔 What is AI/ML?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is about teaching computers to do things that typically require human intelligence - like recognizing faces, understanding language, or making decisions.

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI where instead of programming every rule, we show computers examples and let them learn patterns.

### Real-World Examples You Use Daily
- **Email Spam Filtering**: Gmail automatically sorts spam
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix suggests movies you'll like
- **Voice Assistants**: Siri and Alexa understand your speech
- **Photo Tagging**: Facebook recognizes your friends in photos

## 🛠️ Setting Up Your Environment

### Option 1: Cloud-Based (Recommended for Beginners)
**Google Colab** - Free, no installation required!
1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "New Notebook"
4. You're ready to code!

### Option 2: Local Installation
**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 20GB free disk space

**Installation Steps:**
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/0xKatie/ai-ml-mastery-hub.git
cd ai-ml-mastery-hub

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Your First AI/ML Program

Let's build a simple program that predicts house prices! Don't worry about understanding every detail - we'll explain as we go.

### Step 1: Open a New Notebook
- In Google Colab: Click "New Notebook"
- Locally: Run `jupyter notebook` and create a new Python 3 notebook

### Step 2: Import Libraries
```python
# These are your AI/ML superpowers!
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("🎉 Libraries imported successfully!")
```

### Step 3: Create Sample Data
```python
# Let's create some fake house data
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducible results

# Features: [Square Feet, Bedrooms, Age of House]
house_features = np.random.rand(100, 3)
house_features[:, 0] *= 3000  # Square feet (0-3000)
house_features[:, 1] *= 5     # Bedrooms (0-5)
house_features[:, 2] *= 50    # Age (0-50 years)

# Simple price formula: bigger, more bedrooms, newer = higher price
house_prices = (house_features[:, 0] * 100 + 
                house_features[:, 1] * 10000 + 
                (50 - house_features[:, 2]) * 1000 + 
                np.random.rand(100) * 50000)

print(f"📊 Created data for {len(house_prices)} houses")
print(f"💰 Price range: ${house_prices.min():.0f} - ${house_prices.max():.0f}")
```

### Step 4: Train Your AI Model
```python
# Split data: 80% for training, 20% for testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    house_features, house_prices, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("🤖 AI model trained successfully!")
```

### Step 5: Make Predictions
```python
# Let's predict prices for our test houses
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare predictions with actual prices
results = pd.DataFrame({
    'Actual Price': y_test,
    'Predicted Price': predictions,
    'Difference': abs(y_test - predictions)
})

print("🔮 Predictions made! Here are the first 5:")
print(results.head())

# Calculate how accurate our model is
accuracy = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions) ** 0.5
print(f"\n📈 Average prediction error: ${accuracy:.0f}")
```

### Step 6: Visualize Results
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions, alpha=0.7)
plt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], 'r--', lw=2)
plt.xlabel('Actual Price')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Price')
plt.title('🏠 House Price Predictions vs Reality')
plt.show()

print("🎯 The closer points are to the red line, the better our predictions!")
```

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You just built your first AI/ML model! Here's what happened:

1. **Data**: You created features (house characteristics) and targets (prices)
2. **Training**: The model learned the relationship between features and prices
3. **Prediction**: The model estimated prices for houses it had never seen
4. **Evaluation**: You measured how accurate the predictions were

## 🗺️ What's Next?

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Explore**: Try changing the house features or price formula
2. **Learn**: Read [Core Concepts](../01-foundations/core-concepts.md)
